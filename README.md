# BinGameV2
Bachelor's Thesis
The goal of the Bachelor's Thesis was to design and program an application that
teachers could use for computer science lessons. We chosed the topic binary number system.

The application consists of 3 activities.
1. activity:
The goal of the first activity is to fill the squares correctly. Count of squares on cards are 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. Each card represents an order in binary
system. Squares can be filled by tapping on the square. If the user would like to change the squares to their original state, user must use the long hold gesture. 
At the same time, the number of remaining squares is increased by the number of filled squares on the card.
To check if the cards are filled correctly user can use the check button and image with message will be displayed.
If the cards are filled correctly, the cards will change how the number of squares would look in binary number system.

2. activity:
The user can set the bits to 0 or 1 according to the given number in decimal number system.
The goal is set 5 bits in binary number system that it represents the given number in decimal system. It is displayed below each bit
Value of bits in decimal number system is displayed under the cards so that the user can see their values and to simplify them the translation.

3. activity:
In the last activity user has to answer correctly whether equality applies to the numbers displayed in both decimal and binary.
Goal is to solve 10 assignments. User has 15 seconds to answer one assignment. The bits are randomly generated (1 or 0) and also the number in decimal system is generated randomly. After answering all the assignments, the number of correct/incorrect answers is evaluated.
